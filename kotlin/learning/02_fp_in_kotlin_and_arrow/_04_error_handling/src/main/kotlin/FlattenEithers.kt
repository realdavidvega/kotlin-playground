// Error handling and data validation
// Flattening Either operations

// Sometimes we have a list of elements to perform an Either operation on, but iterating over the list performing all
// those operations would return a List<Either<A, B>> which is hard to deal with, since we would need to go element
// by element checking whether it's a Left or a Right.

// Arrow provides traverseEither to solve this concern

// Doesn't take the short-circuiting behavior into account. It runs for all ids regardless of the result of each call.

// Let's fix it with traverse:
val flattenSpeakers: Either<SpeakerErrors, List<Speaker>> =
    ids.traverse { findSpeaker(it) }
// Flattened, and short-circuits!

// Note how the result effectively swaps the data types. What it was List<Either<A, B>> before is
// Either<A, List<B>> now, which is much easier to handle.
