// Either<L, R> represents an exclusive disjunction between two typed values. A value in Either can be either
// of type R which represents the happy path, or it can have type L, which is the alternative path.

// It is often used to model and make explicit the duality between error and success in our domain.
// It is a sealed class with two possible implementations: Left and Right.
// You have examples of some error handling strategies in the official docs.
