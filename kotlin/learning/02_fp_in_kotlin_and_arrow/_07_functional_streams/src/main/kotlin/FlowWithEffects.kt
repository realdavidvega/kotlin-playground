// Functional Streams
// Evaluating effects
// We understand "functional streams" as streams able to evaluate side effects and emit their results.
// We can write those effects using suspend and leverage Arrow Fx operators as needed.

// Here is an example of a Flow making use of Either.catch, which is a suspend function meant for
// catching errors in effects.
